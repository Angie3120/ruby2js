There's only so much you can do with a README on GitHub and then it's time for an upgrade. ðŸ˜Ž

So here it is! The brand new **Ruby2JS** documentation site. Now that we have a spiffy new home on the interwebs, we'll be polishing up and adding additional documentation and examples, as well as posting news updates as features and improvements get added to the project.

Many thanks to [Sam Ruby](https://github.com/rubys) for giving me (Jared) so much runway to transition everything over to the new site (and a [new org on GitHub!](https://github.com/ruby2js)). Lots more exciting news in store for 2021!
